<b> FullLife has less bulk while providing more convenience, comfort, and performance.</b>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
Smaller and lighter - yet highly durable. That's what we created with the FullLife full-face mask. A revolutionary design makes FullLife a great choice for both men and women who need a full-face mask but prefer something more compact and less intrusive than other full-face masks. To accomplish that, we eliminated the conventional forehead pad and provided a clear sight line. To enhance comfort, we used a dual-textured cushion that aids with assembly and prevents mask movement on the face. A clever headgear design further improves mask fit while simplifying application and removal.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
With just one faceplate to fit all sizes - plus our FitPack and DuoPack options - FullLife is more comfortable for you as well. Sometimes helping you fit 100% of your patients, 100% of the time means giving you less, while still finding ways to give you much, much more. Visit the Features and Finding the right fit resources on this Web site to see how the FullLife mask can be your full solution.

<b>Features</b>
<ul>
<li>The FullLife full-face mask was designed specifically to provide a practical option for those patients who need the performance of a full-face mask but prefer a more compact and less intrusive mask. With FullLife, we're meeting that need, while helping you achieve the long-term compliance and results for which you and your patients strive.
</li>
<br><br> 
<li>
<b>A minimal mask with a full set of features</b>
<br><br>
We developed FullLife with a minimalist approach. We wanted to minimize bulkiness and weight. Yet, we challenged ourselves to maximize performance, comfort, and durability. One of the primary ways we did that was to eliminate the traditional forehead pad. That, in turn, removed a common pressure point and cleared the wearer's view.
<br><br>
And, while FullLife may be small in stature, its dual-textured cushion surface creates a robust seal even during patient movement at night. Helping to keep everything securely in place, our straightforward, step-by-step numbered headgear system assures seal, while simplifying application and removal.
</li>
 <br><br> 
<li>
<b>Minimal inventory for you to manage</b>
<br><br>
With just one faceplate for all sizes (S, M, and L), plus the convenience of our FitPack and DuoPack kits, FullLife is designed to help you fit more of your patients with fewer parts and less inventory to manage. It's a quicker, simpler solution based directly on input from customers like you.
