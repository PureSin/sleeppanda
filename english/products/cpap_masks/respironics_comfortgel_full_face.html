<b>Inspired by our most popular mask.</b>
<br><br>
Based on the worldwide popularity of the Respironics ComfortGel nasal mask, we've developed the innovative and practical ComfortGel Full mask. Featuring the highly popular Respironics blue gel plus advanced sure seal technology (SST) flap, ComfortGel Full is a first-class upgrade for your patients who need a full-face mask. When you consider the comfort benefits, its replaceable cushion design and our approach to cushion resupply, our ComfortGel Full mask will surely be a best-in-class fit for you as well.
<br><br>

The Respironics ComfortGel Full mask is latex free.
