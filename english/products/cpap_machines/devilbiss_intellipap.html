<p>
The clean sophisticated design of the DeVilbiss IntelliPAP Standard CPAP System clearly points the way towards the future of CPAP therapy. From the ground up the IntelliPAP has been designed with patients in mind including whisper quiet operation (26 dBA average), an exceptionally small footprint, a complete feature set, the industry's longest standard warranty (3 years!), automatic altitude adjusment, adjustable ramp, and more. When travel is a concern take advantage of the compact design allowing the CPAP, humidifier, hose and accessories to store away in its travel bag.

<b>Features</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Integrated Heated Humidifier</b>
<br>
    Built for durability, the unit is water resistant, has a stainless steel heat transfer plate and a water chamber constructed of Lexan (polycarbonate resin thermoplastic). Use the optional heated humidifier to provide additional comfort and humidity for your sleep therapy. Powering the unit is achieved through docking with the CPAP, eliminating the need for bulky power adapters or extra hoses. The exclusive humidifier chamber is easy to remove and designed to maximize humidity with a larger surface area. DeVilbiss designed the chamber to hold enough water for a full night's sleep and along with the unique baffle design, the water chamber allows the airflow to collect more humidity. Even at the humidifier's highest setting, you can still expect a full 8 hours of humidification.</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>SmartFlex Technology</b>
<br>
    DeVilbiss jumps into the enhanced comfort market with the introduction of SmartFlex. This unique exhalation relief function provides three levels of customizable pressure reduction and six rounding options to tailor the transition between inhalation to exhalation. Like many existing pressure reduction technologies, SmartFlex lowers exhalation pressure by 1cmH20 per level (up to 3 cmH20), allowing users to breathe easier against their therapy pressure. What sets the IntelliPAP apart is its transitional rounding feature that prevents the user from experiencing adverse IPAP/EPAP pressure changes. When pressure drops during exhalation, the increase back to the prescribed therapy setting can disrupt the sleep cycle. In similar technologies, users may find themselves struggling against the transition and lose the benefits of exhalation relief. Now, SmartFlex's rounding function makes pressure comfort technology virtually seamless.</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>Advanced Therapy Tracking</b>
<br>
    Sleep data is essential feedback for therapy compliance, but many basic CPAP machines lack detailed reporting capabilities. The IntelliPAP Standard Plus records advanced data such as apnea/hypopneas, non-response, snoring and exhale puff event detection. Use SmartCode or the optional SmartLink Therapy Management software to download your sleep data to view the IntelliPAP's expanded reporting capabilities. Alternatively, use the Quick View feature on the machine and preview data (Days on Therapy, AHI, High Leak and Average Daily Usage hours) all from the on-board LCD display. Quick View readings are also available through the SmartCode online reporting.</li>
<br><br>
<li><b>SmartCode</b>
<br>
    SmartCode is a simple and easy way to review your sleep performance without the need to purchase software. Starting the day after your first treatment, the IntelliPAP machine begins to display SmartCode messages on your machine's screen. Each message is a unique encrypted code containing the results of your sleep therapy. The IntelliPAP quickly confirms compliance using the Adherence Score. Doctors use the Adherence percentage score to determine whether a user is in compliance with CPAP LCD (Local Coverage Determination). SmartCodes report Adherence based on the best consecutive thirty days of usage. Codes can be generated for the following calendar schedule:
<ul>
        <li>1 Day</li>
        <li>7 Days</li>
        <li>30 Days</li>
        <li>90 Days</li>
        <li>Cumulative</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
