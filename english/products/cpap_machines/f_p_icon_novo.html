Fisher and Paykel has taken several features from their SleepStyle line of CPAP machines and combined those and more to enhance patient comfort and provide a personalized therapy system. The ICON Novo is the entry model and sets the standard, incorporating optional ThermoSmart technology in a streamlined body. The built-in heated humidifier and optional heated hose delivers condensation-free humidification at the touch of a button. The ICON is ideal for home or travel and comes with an alarm clock and music playing capability.

Manufactured by Fisher & Paykel. This is a newly released product.

<b>Features</b>
<br><br>
All ICON machines come with a built-in heated humidifier and ThermoSmart Technology. The Novo model establishes the ICON CPAP platform and includes standard features like:
<ul>
    <li>Manual Altitude Adjustment</li>
    <li>Ramp</li>
    <li>Compliance Reporting</li>
</ul>
</p>

<b>Humidification</b>
<br>
Under normal circumstances the air you breathe is naturally heated as it travels through your nasal passages. CPAP therapy works against this natural humidification. CPAP airflow drys the nasal passages and can lead to congestion and mouth breathing. Typical heated CPAP humidification helps re-saturate therapy air, but effectiveness is restricted by ambient temperatures. As the room cools, most humidifiers cannot keep relative humidity levels at the mask, usually resulting in condensation forming in the CPAP hose. ThermoSmart Technology delivers custom levels of high humidity that are maintained throughout the night, regardless of ambient temperature. The ICON uses sensors that track ambient room temperature to reduce condensation.
<br>
To maximize the ICON's capabilities, Fisher and Paykel offer an optional heated breathing tube that works in conjunction with ThermoSmart Technology. This heated CPAP hose contains copper coils embedded in tubing. These coils conduct heat and can provide a constant temperature throughout the hose. The optional ThermoSmart breathing tube virtually eliminates rain-out and condensation in a CPAP hose.
<br>
As an added benefit, ThermoSmart can also help lower overall therapy pressures. As higher levels of humidity start to relieve swelling within your nasal passages, resistance to therapy pressures can decrease and lower levels of therapy may become effective.

<b>SmartDial, Alarm Clock, and AlarmTunes</b>
<br>
The compact design and clock functionality makes the Fisher and Pykel ICON an ideal substitute for the bedside night stand. The ICON incorporates a single SmartDial that uses a "Press-Turn-Press" principle. Turn the dial to access efficacy data from the display or set the built-in alarm clock and music playing ability with the AlarmTunes function. Use the SmartStick Studio software to upload your favorite songs and have the ICON's alarm start your morning with music!
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<b>InfoSmart and SmartStick</b>
<br>
Track your therapy effectiveness with InfoSmart and the SmartStick. The software offers detailed reporting including data regarding compliance, AHI, leak and pressure readings. SmartStick Technology is a unique memory card that connects directly to a USB drive, without a separate card reader. The SmartStick is used to easily transfer data from your CPAP to Fisher and Paykel InfoSmart Software.
