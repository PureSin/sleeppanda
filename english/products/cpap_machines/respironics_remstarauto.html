</p>
<br><br><br><br>

The following are all of the features of the 60 Series APAP:
<br><br>
<ul>
<b>On screen data display</b>
<br>
The screen on the 60 Series APAP machine will display the leak rate, AHI (apnea/hypopnea index), and 7 and 30 day average pressures. This information is also stored in an on-board memory as well as on an SD memory card.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>System One Resistance Control</b>
<br>
Each Respironics mask is assigned a number according to the resistance characteristics of that mask. System One Resistance Control is able to recognize the number of each mask and tells the machine to adjust accordingly to deliver you the idea pressure for your specific mask.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Flex technology</b>
<br>
Flex technology makes breathing with CPAP therapy easier and more natural. The 60 Series APAP includes C-Flex, C-Flex Plus, and A-Flex settings. C-Flex simply lowers the pressure during exhalation to provide relief. C-Flex Plus makes the transition between the inhalation and exhalation pressures smoother to increase comfort. A-Flex goes one step further by providing the lowest pressure required to keep your airway open while you sleep. It will change the pressure to your ideal level throughout the night to eliminate apneas and hypopneas without raising it too high. Flex family technology allows you to have the most comfortable and natural breathing experience possible.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Heated TubeSystem One Humidity Control and Heated Tube</b>
<br>
The System One 60 Series Heated Humidifier and Heated Tube provide you with temperature and humidity control, improved humidification, and rainout protection. The durable, 15 mm heated tube snaps on to the 270 degree swivel mount on the top of the 60 Series APAP machine. The tube also has a room temperature/humidity sensor at its end that ensures that you receive the proper level of humidity and are protected against rainout. Even as the room temperature changes throughout the night, the temperature and humidity level of your heated tube will remain the same and will provide evenly humidified air all the way from the machine to the mask. There are 3 levels of relative humidity (70, 80, or 90%) and 5 temperature settings (4-16 degrees above room temperature) from which to choose. The system also includes Dry Box with a one-way valve to prevent water damage to the machine.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Please note:</b>
<br>
The heated humidifier and heated tube of the PR System One REMStar 60 Series APAP can only be used together and with this machine. They are not compatible with any other PR machine, nor is the heated tube compatible with any other PR humidifier. The PR System One REMStar 60 Series APAP machine is not compatible with earlier versions of the PR System One Heated Humidifier. Also, the external power supply included with this system will not work with any other PR units.<br><br></li>
