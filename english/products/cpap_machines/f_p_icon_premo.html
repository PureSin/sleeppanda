The ICON Premo incorporates Optional ThermoSmart technology and advanced reporting into a streamlined body.

Manufactured by Fisher & Paykel. This is a newly released product.

<b>Features</b>
<br><br>
All ICON machines come with a built-in heated humidifier and ThermoSmart Technology. The ICON Premo elevates the standard CPAP platform and includes premium features like:
<ul>
    <li>Efficacy Reporting (AHI and Leak)</li>
    <li>Auto Altitude Adjustment</li>
    <li>Leak Compensation</li>
    <li>Advanced Software Reporting</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Humidification</b>
<br><br>
Under normal circumstances the air you breathe is naturally heated as it travels through your nasal passages. CPAP therapy works against this natural humidification. CPAP airflow drys the nasal passages and can lead to congestion and mouth breathing. Typical heated CPAP humidification helps re-saturate therapy air, but effectiveness is restricted by ambient temperatures. As the room cools, most humidifiers cannot keep relative humidity levels at the mask, usually resulting in condensation forming in the CPAP hose. ThermoSmart Technology delivers custom levels of high humidity that are maintained throughout the night, regardless of ambient temperature. The ICON uses sensors to track ambient room temperature and a heated CPAP tube to prevent condensation. ThermoSmart virtually eliminates rain-out and condensation in a CPAP hose.
</p>
<p>
As an added benefit, ThermoSmart can also help lower overall therapy pressures. As higher levels of humidity start to relieve swelling within your nasal passages, resistance to therapy pressures can decrease and lower levels of therapy may become effective.

<p>
<b>SmartDial, Alarm Clock, and AlarmTunes</b>
<br><br>
The compact design and clock functionality makes the Fisher and Pykel ICON an ideal substitute for the bedside night stand. The ICON incorporates a single SmartDial that uses a "Press-Turn-Press" principle. Turn the dial to access efficacy data from the display or set the built-in clock and MP3 player with AlarmTunes function. Use the AlarmTunes software to upload your favorite MP3-formatted songs and have the ICON's alarm start your morning with music!
</p>
<p>
<b>InfoSmart and SmartStick</b>
<br><br>
Track your therapy effectiveness with InfoSmart and the SmartStick. The software offers detailed reporting including data regarding compliance, AHI, leak and pressure readings. SmartStick Technology is a unique memory card that connects directly to a USB drive, without a separate card reader. The SmartStick is used to easily transfer data from your CPAP to Fisher and Paykel InfoSmart Software
