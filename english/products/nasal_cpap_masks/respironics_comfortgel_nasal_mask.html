<b> Higher level of fit and comfort</b>
<br>
The ComfortGel nasal mask was discontinued on December 31, 2010. Please visit the ComfortGel Blue web site to learn more about our most recent nasal gel mask.
</p>
<br> 
<p>
The ComfortGel nasal mask with robust design brings a higher level of fit and comfort to the Comfort Series. An exciting approach to fully customizable gel masks combines premium comfort features with a host of innovations. These changes help the ComfortGel fit right the first time. And that helps the Comfort Series fit 100% of your patients 100% of the time.
</p>
<br> 
<p>
ComfortGel uses Respironics’ one-size-fits-most Premium Headgear. This unique headgear with EZPeel tabs easily adjusts in four places for a secure, custom fit. The Premium Headgear evenly distributes tension, adds stability and helps to prevent mask leaks. ComfortGel and headgear disassemble easily for cleaning and replacement. The headgear can be used with most Respironics masks.

<b>Features</b>
<ul>
<li>Comfortable and customizable, the most popular of the Comfort Series of masks fits right the first time.</li>

<li>The ComfortGel nasal mask makes it easier to fit patients right the first time – even hard-to-fit patients. At its core is an exceptional cushion that combines the customizable blue gel originally seen in the Respironics Profile Lite with a proven dual-layer cushion design found in other Comfort Series masks. This combination gives you the comfort, fit, stability, and seal characteristics you’ve come to expect from Comfort Series masks.</li>

<li>This superior cushion is paired with the StabilitySelector that tilts the mask to allow for an optimal seal. The forehead support and pad automatically adjust to ensure proper forehead placement and angle. Combining the StabilitySelector and the dual-material cushion with a “silent” exhalation port and ball-and-socket headgear attachments adds up to a superior mask that can help your patients stick to their therapy.</li>

<li>Delivering more features in a smaller, more compact package makes the ComfortGel an easy choice. Our streamlined sizing system makes it easier to stock. The ComfortGel as part of the Comfort Series makes it possible to fit 100% of your patients 100% of the time.</li>
