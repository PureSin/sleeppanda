<b> OptiLife fits your life – and makes your life easier.</b>
<br><br>
Life is a balancing act, and it’s hard enough to fit in all your existing obligations without adding anything new – even something as small as a new sleep therapy mask. But the Respironics OptiLife mask is easy to fit into your life, because it makes life easier for sleep lab professionals, homecare providers and patients.
<br><br>
Get a closer look at the new Respironics OptiLife in the features and fitting sections of this site, and you’ll see how the easy-to-fit, easy-to-assemble, easy-to-clean OptiLife mask doesn’t just fit patients’ faces, it fits their lives. And as a sleep lab professional or homecare provider, OptiLife fits the life of your business, too.
<br><br>
OptiLife is latex free.

<b>Features</b>
<br><br>
OptiLife is designed to be easier to use with features that make life easier for patients, sleep professionals and providers alike. The mask comes with advanced flexible mask tubing - at the critical point where the tubing meets the mask - to create an optimal seal in any sleep position. Optilife also has two cushion options - the traditional pillows cushion, which inserts into the nostrils, and the CradleCushion, which sits under the nose.
<ul>
<li><b>Designed to fit a patient's life</b>
<br>
OptiLife features a unique headgear design and a chin support band that allow it to be easily put on and adjusted with little effort and no buckles. In fact, OptiLife is so easy-to-use that the mask can be put into place with one hand. Plus, OptiLife is easy-to-clean and maintain, and it's durable enough to stand up to the real-world demands of daily use.

<li><b>Designed to fit the life of the sleep lab professional</b>
<br>
OptiLife is an ideal mask for introducing new patients to sleep therapy. It's also easy for your staff to clean, assemble and seal patients quickly during titration. OptiLife better accommodates side sleepers and leaves the forehead open for polysomnographic leads.
</li>
 

<li><b>Designed to fit the life of the homecare provider</b>
<br>
We gave OptiLife the features to enhance compliance and acceptance by your patients. Its robust seal, two comfortable cushion options (pillows and CradleCushion), buckleless headgear, wide range of sizes and quiet design help patients stay compliant with their therapy. All of which helps you manage your patients and business more effectively.
