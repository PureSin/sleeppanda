<b>Built for men. Engineered for stability</b>
<br><br>
GoLife for Men – first sleep therapy mask built exclusively for men. More than just a color change, GoLife for Men is designed specifically to conform to the larger contours of the male facial structure. It features straightforward, pre-formed headgear and self-adjusting, optimally angled nasal pillows for a one-step fit.

<b> Built for a man’s face</b>
<br><br>
    GoLife for Men was designed specifically to conform to the larger contours of the male face. Facial contour arms hug the cheeks, helping to provide comfort and a secure seal, even when moving during sleep. In fact, GoLife for Men is so stable, we’ve eliminated the need for a chin support band.

<b> Features:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Optimized for comfort<br>
    Using GoLife for Men is highly intuitive and as natural as possible. The pre-formed headgear and self-adjusting, optimally angled nasal pillows may help to provide comfort and require minimal to no adjustments during regular use. A 360-degree swivel on the mask’s tubing further enhances both comfort and flexibility.
</li>
    <li>Simplified for everyone<br>
    For simplicity, GoLife for Men has few parts and comes with all sizes—petite, small, medium, and large. It also offers easy one-step fitting thanks to a one-piece headgear and self-adjusting pillows. This means less time fitting the mask and may help provide more effective titrations and fewer callbacks .
