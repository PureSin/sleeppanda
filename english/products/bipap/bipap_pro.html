<b>Everything You Expect and More</b>
<br><br>
The System One BIPAP/Bilevel Pro includes all of the great features you expect from a sleep therapy system including a wide pressure range (4-25cm), patient adjustable ramp, AUTOMATIC altitude adjustment, data card, the latest BiFlex comfort technologies, and a universal power supply. In addition the BIPAP/Bilevel Pro is an fixed pressure bi-level system so it will adjust your inhalation and expiration levels throughout the night to ensure you are receiving optimum pressure for the most comfortable and successful sleep experience. On top of this the BIPAP/Bilevel Pro features resistance control technologies that adjust to different mask styles, and advanced therapy tracking capabilities -- including advanced event detection, response and reporting.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<b>Flex Family Technologies - The BIPAP/Bilevel Pro features Bi-FLEX+</b>
<br><br>
Respironics natural and clinically-proven "flex" technologies enhance traditional pressure therapy to improve comfort and increase compliance. Bi-Flex, on the BIPAP/Bilevel Pro, offers pressure relief at inhalation and exhalation to make BIPAP/Bilevel therapy more like natural breathing. By tracking each breath, Bi-Flex pressure relief technology always delivers pressure relief just when it is needed for an improved sleep experience.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<b>System One Humidity Control and Dry Box Technology</b>
<br><br>
Many BIPAP/Bilevel users find that the addition of heated humidity to their sleep therapy system improves comfort and helps with overall compliance. The optional System One Heated Humidifier delivers optimum humidity, drastically reduces rainout, and provides ultimate comfort throughout the night by analyzing and adjusting to ambient temperature, changing environmental conditions, relative humidity, and therapy flow. Revolutionary Dry Box technology isolates the humidfier's water source from the inner workings of the device to protect against accidental spillage and water damage.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<b>System One Resistance Control</b>
<br><br>
System One Resistance Control achieves complete system comfort by enabling the device and mask to work optimally together. Through simple settings, the System One Resistance Control instructs your BIPAP/Bilevel to compensate for variable resistance characteristics related to different masks. The result is synchronous pressure delivery and the assurance you can enjoy the full benefits of Respironics Flex comfort technologies no matter which mask is used.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<b>System One Humidity Control for Comfort</b>
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
Delivering consistent humidity levels throughout the night, at the mask, improves sleep therapy comfort and compliance. The System One uses a simple dial to adjust relative humidity at the mask. What The PR System One's Humidity Control system monitors room temperature, room humidity, and air flow enabling it to maintain your preferred humidity levels, even when environmental conditions change. By controlling relative humidity output at the mask, rather than simply setting the humidifier temperature at higher or lower levels, System One Humidity Control provides a custom sleep experience and it helps prevent rainout too!
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
<b>Dry Box Technology For Safety</b>
<br><br>
Through the combination of a cleverly-designed water chamber and an advanced "Dry Box" design the System One Heated Humidifier virtually eliminates the risk of water spillage and ingress into the device. Even when filled to the "FULL" indicator line the System One's water chamber can be tilted or turned upside down without leaking back into the device. And should any water manage to escape the chamber the Dry Box will prevent it from entering the device itself.
