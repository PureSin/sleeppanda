<b>Do I require a prescription for a CPAP therapy?</b>
<br>
In Canada you do require a prescription from your sleep physician to purchase a CPAP system. 
You can purchase CPAP supplies such as masks, CPAP tubing, water chambers and filters without prescription.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the cost of CPAP therapy?</b>
<br>
CPAP systems could cost between $ 1040 to $2000 depending on the machine, type of mask, and level of service chosen by the patient. Basic machine & mask will be $ 1040.The ADP covers a part of the cost of a CPAP system (currently $780). The client portion of the cost will be a minimum of $260. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Does the OHIP cover the costs of CPAP therapy?</b>
<br>
CPAP therapy is partially funded from government for Ontario residents. The Assistive Devices Program (ADP) is the program in Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care that will cover 75% of the cost of your equipment up to a maximum of $780. If you are receiving social assistance benefits from Ontario Works (OW) or Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), you may be eligible for more funding. 
</p>
<p>
We are fully licensed by ADP to bill the cost of the equipment directly to OHIP. You can find out more information about Ministry of Health funding by contacting ADP: 1-800-268-6021 or visit their website:

<p>
<b>Please Note: ADP does not allow patients to submit claims on their own behalf. These claims must be billed from a CPAP provider with an ADP provider number.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>How to claim my health insurance for CPAP?</b>
<br>
If you have any regular benefit from work, the remaining porting of the cost could be covered by your insurance company depending on the program your employer offers.When you are CPAP trial with us, we will do a pre-approval with your insurance so you know what your plan will cover before you have to decide on purchase.
