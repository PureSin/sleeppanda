<b>How do I choose the best mask to suit me?</b>
<br>
It is important to pick a mask that is comfortable and does not place pressure on the sensitive areas of the face, the nasal bridge, and upper lip. We suggest you try on as many as you can, talk to other users, and look at our websites:cpap.sleeppanda.ca
</p>
<p>
<b>I have a moustache. Which mask will be the best choice?</b>
<br>
Some masks have a very thin membrane, which will typically seal even with a moustache. The shallow cushion in particular is ideal for patients with a moustache, as they may need to adjust the cushion in closer to the top lip. The shallow cushion allows the user to angle the cushion more and maintain the seal at the bridge of the nose.
</p>
<p>
<b>When is a full face mask preferable to a nasal mask?</b>
<br>
If you mouth breathe or have mouth leaks, then a Full Face Mask will provide a number of benefits over a nasal mask. A full face mask will stop air loss that can compromise treatment, and it can resolve dry throat and nose problems. If you mouth breathe or have leaks, you will not be receiving your full treatment pressure and thus may not be getting the full benefits of your treatment.
</p>
<p>
<b>Are there other benefits from using a full face mask?</b>
<br>
Even if you don't mouth breathe, you may still experience mouth leaks. Mouth leaks can contribute to decreased treatment effectiveness and consequent symptoms of poor therapy.
</p>
<p>
<b>My doctor says that my nose is blocked on one side from a deviated septum. Which type of mask is better?</b>
<br>
With a deviated septum, you are likely breathing through your mouth due to your nasal passage being blocked. A full face mask will certainly work for you and would allow you the option of breathing through your nose and/or mouth. If your mouth is dry in the morning, you are probably breathing through your mouth.
</p>
<p>
<b>I normally use a nasal mask. Can I use a full face mask when I have a cold?</b>
<br>
Yes, however the thing to remember is that every mask has slightly different flow characteristics, so if you're using a ResMed series device, you'll need to change the mask setting on the user menu when you switch masks. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Which is more comfortable? A nasal mask or full face mask?</b>
<br>
Everyone is different. Some people find that they prefer a full face mask while others prefer a nasal mask. It is really personal preference. However, both nasal and full face masks utilize the same cushion technology that inflates to form a floating seal, maximizing patient comfort.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why and how often should I replace my mask cushion?</b>
<br>
You should replace your mask cushion periodically because as it becomes worn, it becomes less effective. 
The life of a mask cushion depends on use, the oils from your skin, and cleaning. It is always a good idea to inspect your mask routinely; poor care may adversely affect the fit of the cushion and thus performance. 
</p>
<p>
To get the longest life from your mask, be sure to wash your face each night before putting on your mask, and wash your mask after each use. Use only mild soap, nothing with perfumes, moisturizers, antibacterial agents, bleaches, etc, always dry your mask and cushion out of direct sunlight. 
</p>
<p>
Poor performance is often the first clue that your cushion may need replacement. Check for small tears or pinholes, anything that might cause a leak. Household pets have been known to damage cushions by playing with them and so have children, so you may want to keep your mask out of reach. Also, be sure you don't leave your mask somewhere that receives direct sunlight during the day.
</p>
<p>
<b>Why and how often should I replace my headgear?</b>
<br>
You will need to replace your headgear occasionally. Like mask cushions, the life of headgear depends on use, the oils from your skin, and care (cleaning, etc). Taking good care of your mask is the key to maintaining the best performance and mask fit. Wash your headgear at least once per week and dry it out of direct sunlight. If you have oily skin or hair, you may need to wash it more often. 
Headgear should last longer than a mask cushion, but it will depend on use and environment. call us today to find out how often your insurance will pay for new headgear.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I buy individual replacement mask components like cushions,clips, straps and port caps?</b>
<br>
Yes. 
<br>
All mask components can be purchased separately, check website: cpap.sleeppana.ca.  
</p>
<p>
<b>When and how should I clean my mask?</b>
<br>
<b>Daily</b>
<br>
Wash the mask system with warm, soapy water.
Do not use soaps with added scents. Rinse well and allow to air dry out of direct sunlight.
</p>
<p>
<b>Weekly</b>
<br>
Separate and hand wash the mask components and headgear in warm, soapy water. Do not use soaps with added scents. 
Rinse the components well and allow them to air dry out of direct sunlight.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cautions</b>
<ul>
<li>Do not use solutions containing vinegar, bleach, chlorine, alcohol, aromatics, moisturizers, antibacterial agents or scented oils to clean any part of the system or air tubing. These solutions may cause damage and reduce the life of the product.</li>
<li>Do not expose any part of the system or tubing to direct sunlight as it may deteriorate the product.</li>
<li>If any visible deterioration of a component is apparent (cracking, tears, etc.) the component should be discarded and replaced.</li>
</ul>
Note:
<ul> 
<li>The headgear may be washed without being taken apart. </li>
<li>The dye used in the headgear may run during the first wash </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the best way to adjust my mask for a proper fit?</b>
<br>
Facial muscles change when we lie down and further relax once we are asleep, so it is always best to fit the mask while you are in your sleeping position. If you sleep in a bed with no pillows, fit your mask like that. If you sleep in a recliner, fit your mask that way.
</p>
<p>
<b>How can I keep my mask on at night? I often find out that I’ve removed it in my sleep.</b>
<br>
This type of problem is likely occurring due to nasal congestion. If you have a history of sinus and allergy problems, you may be better treated with a full face mask and/or humidification. You should discuss this with your CPAP therapist.
</p>
<p>
<b>Do I have the correct mask size? I have to strap it so tight ( to mask a seal) that hurts.</b>
<br>
It probably means you have an incorrectly fitted mask. When using a mask, it is important not to over-tighten the mask system. If you can only get a good seal by over-tightening the headgear, you probably have the wrong size cushion or an incorrectly adjusted forehead support. If you are using a mask that has a dial, it is important to note that you has set the dial at the optimal position and adjusting it significantly from that position may cause discomfort.
</p>
<p>
<b>If the electricity goes off while I sleep, will I be able to breathe through my full face mask?</b>
<br>
Yes.
<br>
Full Face Masks have a special anti-asphyxia valve that opens if your PAP device loses power. This feature allows you to breathe room air in the event of a power failure.
</p>
<p>
<b>My mask is leaking. What does this mean?</b>
<br>
This may indicate one of several things:
<ul>
<li>incorrect adjustment</li>
<li>incorrect assembly</li>
<li>incorrect size</li>
<li>mask is worn out and needs replacement</li>
</ul>
