<b>How does CPAP therapy work? </b>
<br>
CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) treats OSA by providing a gentle flow of positive-pressure air through a facial mask to keep the airway open during sleep. As a result:
<ul>
<li>Breathing becomes regular during sleep</li>
<li>Snoring stops</li>
<li>Restful sleep is restored</li>
<li>Quality of life is improved</li>
<li>Risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and motor vehicle and work accidents is reduced</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>How effective is treatment? </b>
<br>
Regular use of positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment can minimize the impact of OSA. The benefits of effectively treating the condition through the regular nightly use of PAP treatment may include: 
<ul>
<li>Increased energy and attentiveness during the day</li>
<li>Fewer morning headaches</li>
<li>Reduced irritability</li>
<li>Increased ability to exercise</li>
<li>Increased effectiveness at home and at work</li>
<li>Lower blood pressure</li>
<li>Decreased risk of strokes and heart attacks</li>
<li>Improved overall quality of life</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>When should I start feeling better after beginning to use my CPAP?</b>
<br>
Most patients begin to feel better within the first week of use, though for some people it may take a little longer.
</p>
<p>
<b>What if I still snore while using my CPAP?</b>
<br>
Snoring while on CPAP should not occur. If it does, contact your doctor. Your pressure level might need to be adjusted.
</p>
<p>
<b>What if I lose or gain weight over the course of my treatment or my old symptoms reappear?</b>
<br>
You may need to have your CPAP pressure level adjusted. Contact your us at 905-604-9191. 
</p>
<p>
<b>If I need to be hospitalized for any reason, should I take my device with me and use it at night?</b>
<br>
Yes. Also, if you are having surgery, it is important to tell the surgeon and the anesthesiologist that you are using CPAP at home. You should also inform the doctor treating you for sleep apnea that you are going into the hospital. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My eyes are sore, dry, irritated or swollen. What should I do?</b>
<br>
The mask may be leaking into your eyes. Try pulling the mask away from your face and repositioning it. The mask may be too tight so try readjusting your headgear straps. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My skin seems to be irritated, even bruised, or I have marks on my face. What should I do?</b>
<br>
Your mask may be too tight. If your mask has a forehead arm or adjustment feature, try readjusting that first. Then, if necessary, readjust the headgear straps. You may have the wrong mask size. Call us for a mask fitting. Nasal pillows or a full-face mask may provide a better fit. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My nose and throat are dry; my nose is congested; or, I have nosebleeds. What should I do?</b>
<br>
This condition may improve over time or you can use a higher level of humidification. Consult with a doctor to see if a nasal spray would be advisable. Consult your doctor if the condition persists. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My mouth is dry. What should I do?</b>
<br>
You may be sleeping with your mouth open. Try a chin strap. If a chin strap is not helpful, a full-face mask may be considered or you should call us at 905-604-9191. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I feel gassy and bloated when I wake up in the morning. What should I do?</b>
<br>
Try sleeping with your head elevated or try using a chin strap to prevent mouth breathing. This condition may improve over time. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My mask seems to be leaking. What should I do?</b>
<br>
Check all the connections. If your mask has a forehead arm or adjustment feature, try readjusting that first to correct the leak. If there is no improvement with the above steps, readjust the headgear straps. The mask should be as loose as possible while still creating a seal. A mask that is too tight against the face can cause leaks to occur by creating folds in the material. Talk to the contact us to trying another mask size or type if necessary. 
</p>
<p>
<b>It doesn’t seem as though enough air is flowing to me. What should I do?</b>
<br>
Check that the air from the therapy device is blowing. Then, check the air inlet and filter for obstruction or dust build-up.  Inspect the hose for punctures. If you are still having problems, call us for assistance. 
</p>
<p>
<b>My machine doesn’t seem to be working. What should I do?</b>
<br>
Check the power cord to be sure that it is firmly inserted into the back of the machine and the electrical outlet. If this is not the problem, contact us. Do not attempt to repair the blower on your own. 
</p>
<p>
<b>I just can’t seem to adjust to my CPAP therapy. What should I do?</b>
<br>
Most people will adjust to CPAP in one to two weeks. Occasionally, it may take a little longer if, for example, you are very sensitive to the feel of the mask on your face or the sound of the device. Call us if you continue to have problems beyond two weeks. Ask if you are eligible to try a bi-level or auto-adjusting device.
